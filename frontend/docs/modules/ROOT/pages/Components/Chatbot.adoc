The `Chatbot` component provides a dynamic and interactive chat interface for users to communicate with an AI chatbot. It renders chat messages between a user and a chatbot, including features like typing simulation for the chatbot's responses and automatic scrolling to the latest message.

== Pre-requisite

Ensure you have the `@neo4j-ndl` library installed in your project to use this `Chatbot` component.

== Usage

To integrate the `Chatbot` component into your application, you will first need to import it:

[source,tsx]
----
import Chatbot from './path/to/Chatbot';
----

Next, render the `Chatbot` component in your application's component tree, providing the necessary props:

[source,tsx]
----
<Chatbot messages={listMessages} />
----

`listMessages` should be an array of message objects that you want to display initially.

== Component Props

The `Chatbot` component accepts the following props:

[cols="1,2,1"]
|===
| Name | Description | Required

| `messages`
| An array of message objects that the chatbot will render. Each message object should contain `id`, `user`, `message`, and `datetime` fields. An optional `isTyping` boolean can also be included to simulate the chatbot typing a response.
| Yes
|===

== Message Object Structure

Each message object in the `messages` array prop should follow this structure:

[source,typescript]
----
{
  id: number; // Unique identifier for the message
  user: string; // "user" for user messages, "chatbot" for chatbot messages
  message: string; // The message text
  datetime: string; // Timestamp of the message
  isTyping?: boolean; // Optional, simulates typing effect for chatbot messages
}
----

== Key components


=== Handling State and Effects

The component uses React's `useState` hook to manage:

- `listMessages`: The current list of messages to be displayed.
- `inputMessage`: The current text input by the user.

It also uses the `useEffect` hook to automatically scroll to the bottom of the message list whenever a new message is added thansk to the `messagesEndRef` reference.

=== Submitting Messages

When a user submits a message:

1. It prevents the default form submission behavior.
2. It checks if the message is not empty.
3. It adds the user's message to the `listMessages` state.
4. It clears the input field.
5. It simulates a chatbot response using `simulateTypingEffect`.

=== Simulating Typing Effect

The `simulateTypingEffect` function simulates the chatbot typing a response, displaying one character at a time. Once the message is fully "typed out," it updates the message to indicate the chatbot has finished typing.

== Example

Here is a basic example of using the `Chatbot` component with initial messages:

[source,tsx]
----
const listMessages = [
  {
    id: 1,
    user: 'user',
    message: 'Hello, chatbot!',
    datetime: '01/01/2024 00:00:00',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    user: 'chatbot',
    message: 'Hello! How can I assist you today?',
    datetime: '01/01/2024 00:00:00',
  },
];

<Chatbot messages={listMessages} />
----

This will render a chat interface with two initial messages, one from the user and one from the chatbot.

== Component Integration

Integrating the `Chatbot` component into an existing application is straightforward. Make sure to provide it with the necessary `messages` prop to initialize the chat history. The component handles user inputs and chatbot responses internally, offering a complete chat interface experience out of the box.

Here is an example if you already have a backend application taking care of generating the chatbot's responses and you want to integrate it with this `Chatbot` component:

First, we will set a new state `gettingResponse` that will indicate us if we are currently fetching a response from the backend:

[source, tsx]
----
const [gettingResponse, setGettingResponse] = useState(false);
---- 

Then, we will define a new function `fetchResponseFromAPI` that will be responsible for fetching the chatbot's response from the backend based on the user's message:

[source, tsx]
----
const fetchResponseFromAPI = async () => {
    setGettingResponse(true);
    const requestBody = {
      message: inputMessage
    };

    try {
      const response = await fetch(`<URI_TO_YOUR_BACKEND_API>`, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'accept': 'application/json',
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(requestBody),
      });
      const data = await response.json();
      setGettingResponse(false);
      return data.content;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("API call failed:", error);
      return "Sorry, something went wrong.";
    } finally {
      setGettingResponse(false);
    }
  };
----

WARNING: Ideally you will want to consider using a framework to manage the states, caching and hooks like `tanstack/react-query` for example as well as adding an authentication and authorization to your backend API calls

Then all we need to do is to call this function when the user submits a message, retrieve the response, and simulate the typing effect:
In our `handleSubmit` function:

[source, tsx]
----
const chatbotReply = await fetchResponseFromAPI();
simulateTypingEffect(chatbotReply);
