The `PageNotFoundPage` component is a React component designed to display a user-friendly message when a page is not found (404 error). It provides a visual indication that the requested page is unavailable and offers a button to navigate back to the previous page.

== Pre-requisite

- Ensure you have the `@neo4j-ndl` library installed in your project to use this `PageNotFound` component.

== Usage

To integrate the `PageNotFoundPage` component into your application, ensure it is part of your routing configuration:

1. Import the component:

[source,jsx]
----
import PageNotFoundPage from './path/to/PageNotFoundPage';
----

2. Add a route for the component in your router setup. This is typically done using a catch-all route:

[source,jsx]
----
import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

<Routes>
  // ... All your other routes MUST be before this one
  <Route path="*" element={<PageNotFoundPage />} />
</Routes>
----

== Component Props

The `PageNotFoundPage` component does not accept any props.

== Key components

=== Navigation Hook

The component uses the `useNavigate` hook to programmatically navigate the user back to the previous page:

[source,jsx]
----
const navigate = useNavigate();

<Button onClick={() => navigate(-1)}>Go back</Button>
----

This makes use of the browser's history stack to return the user to where they came from.
