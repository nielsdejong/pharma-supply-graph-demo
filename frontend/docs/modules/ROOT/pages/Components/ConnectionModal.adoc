The ConnectionModal component is a React component designed to handle the connection setup to a Neo4j database. It provides a user-friendly interface for entering database connection details and displays feedback on the connection attempt. This component is particularly useful in applications requiring a dynamic connection to a Neo4j database.

The connection modal also comes with a dropzone for the user to upload a file containing the connection details. The file can be either an Aura credential file you downloaded when creating an instance, or your own file containing the connection details.

The accepted file format are either `.env` or `.txt` file with the following structure:

[cols="1,2,1"]
|===
| Name | Description | Example

| `NEO4J_URI`
| The URI of the Neo4j database. Ideally you would have the protocol, hostname and port, but all are optional and will be defaulted if not present.
| neo4j+s://abcd1234.databases.neo4j.io:7687
| `NEO4J_USERNAME`
| Your neo4j username
| neo4j
| `NEO4J_PASSWORD`
| Your neo4j password
| password
| `NEO4J_DATABASE`
| The database name
| neo4j
|===

Example of a `local.env` file:
[source,env]
----
NEO4J_URI=neo4j://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=password
NEO4J_DATABASE=neo4j
----

== Pre-requisite

- Ensure you have the `@neo4j-ndl` library installed in your project to use this `ConnectionModal` component.
- Ensure you also import the utils/Driver.tsx as it is used for creating the driver connection to the Neo4j Database.

== Usage

To integrate the ConnectionModal component into your application, follow these steps:

1. Import the component:

[source,jsx]
----
import ConnectionModal from './path/to/ConnectionModal';
----

2. Add state to your parent component to control the modal's visibility and to handle the connection status:

[source,jsx]
----
const [isModalOpen, setIsModalOpen] = useState(false);
const [connectionStatus, setConnectionStatus] = useState(false);
----

3. Render the `ConnectionModal` component with the required props:

[source,jsx]
----
<ConnectionModal
  open={isModalOpen}
  setOpenConnection={setIsModalOpen}
  setConnectionStatus={setConnectionStatus}
  message={{ type: 'info', content: 'Please enter your database connection details.' }}
/>
----

== Component Props

The ConnectionModal component accepts the following props:

[cols="1,2,1"]
|===
| Name | Description | Required

| `open`
| A boolean state indicating whether the modal is open or closed.
| Yes
| `setOpenConnection`
| A function to update the `open` state above.
| Yes
| `setConnectionStatus`
| A function to update the parent component's connection status based on the success or failure of the connection attempt.
| Yes
| `message?`
| An optional `Message` object containing a `type` for styling the banner (success, info, warning, danger, neutral) and a `content` string for the message text.
| No
|===

`(Optionnal)` Message object structure:

[source,typescript]
----
{
  type: string; // success | info | warning | danger | neutral
  content: string; // The message content
}
----

== Key components

=== Handling State

The component uses the `useState` hook to manage local state for each connection parameter (protocol, hostname, port, etc.) and the connection message to provide feedback.

=== Submitting the Connection Details

Upon submitting the form:

1. It constructs the connection URI using the selected protocol, hostname, and port.
2. It calls `setDriver` to attempt the database connection.
3. Based on the success or failure of `setDriver`, it updates the connection status and potentially closes the modal or displays an error message.
