== Pre-requisite

- Ensure you have the `@neo4j-ndl` library installed in your project to use this `User` component.

== Usage

To use the User component in your application, you can directly import and place it within your component tree:

[source,jsx]
----
import User from './path/to/User';

// In your component's render method or functional component return statement
<User />
----

== Component Props

The User component does not accept any props. 

== Key components

=== State Management

- `anchorEl`: Used to manage the anchor element for the dropdown menu. It determines the position of the dropdown.
- `open`: A derived state from `anchorEl` to control the visibility of the dropdown menu.

=== Event Handling

- `handleClick`: Sets the `anchorEl` state to the current event target, effectively opening the dropdown menu.
- `handleClose`: Resets the `anchorEl` state to `null`, closing the dropdown menu.
- `menuSelect`: Handles the selection of a menu item. It currently displays an alert with the selected item's name and closes the menu.
