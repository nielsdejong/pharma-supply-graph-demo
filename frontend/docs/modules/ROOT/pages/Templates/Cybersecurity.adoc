== Introduction

The Cybersecurity dashboard is an interface designed to provide a comprehensive overview of network impacts, illustrating potential vulnerabilities and system statuses within a network infrastructure. This tool leverages a dynamic data visualization approach, rendering interactive charts, graphs, and tables.

=== Layout Architecture

The template is structured around a main `Home.tsx` component that encapsulates the entire dashboard's functionality. It includes a dynamic search bar, a tabbed interface for switching between table and graph views, and modals for establishing connections to a Neo4j database.

=== Code Snippets

.Here is a snippet demonstrating the React table setup using `@tanstack/react-table`:

[source,tsx]
----
const columns = [
  columnHelper.accessor('Type', {
    header: () => <b>Type</b>,
    cell: (info) => info.getValue(),
    footer: (info) => info.column.id,
  }),
  // Additional columns defined here...
];

const table = useReactTable({
  data,
  columns,
  enableSorting: true,
  getSortedRowModel: getSortedRowModel(),
  getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel(),
});
----

=== Dataset/Connect to a Neo4j DB

The application utilizes a static JSON dataset named `networkimpact.json` for demonstration purposes. It is not yet designed to connect to a Neo4j database for dynamic data retrieval. However, you can use the `ConnectionModal` component for connecting to a Neo4j Database and implement the logic to retrieve your data into the table in place of the static JSON this template is currently using.

.Connection to Neo4j Database:

[source,tsx]
----
<ConnectionModal
  open={isConnectionModalOpen}
  setOpenConnection={setIsConnectionModalOpen}
  setConnectionStatus={setConnectNeo4j}
/>
----
